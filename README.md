In the event of an error you can either reseed the database with the API. The given seed has admin rights equal to "true". Make sure NOT to drop the database. Ooor you can create an account by going to the "login.modules.css" file and changing the class ".accountBtn" and removing the keyvalue pair Display:None. Afterwards, log into your MongoDB account and change the "Admin" property to "true"
